Chapter 2: Taking a look at GemPy's core
========================================

--------------

In Chapter 1, we presented the general workflow of modeling with GemPy.
That alone is sufficient to succesfully generate complex geological
models. We now go deeper into the theory and the methods that GemPy is
based on.

This chapter is based on the theoretical elaborations presented in the
paper "GemPy 1.0: open-source stochastic geological modeling and
inversion" by De la Varga et al. (2018). \*\*\*
